# Knit project


## Goal
The goal of this program is to redraw an image with only one string. Take a look at Petros Vrellis work to understand the idea (http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/knit.html). The primary algorithm was found in the code of Christian Siegel https://github.com/christiansiegel/knitter. In this project we try to go further improvig the score function, adding a pins arragement tools, adding a feature to select portion of the input image, extending to colors and allowing the user to interact with the process during the runing time!
